# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Project Description**

This is a visual web page displaying Jacques Cousteau (explorer) -- This project sharpend my skills working with HTML and CSS code. I also learned quicker techniques to create grids and implement better practices with short hand code. CCS Block building was something that I got better at. I think the project was entertaining and I enjoy using Figma as a tool for help.

Tools used: Figma, VS Code, TripleTen Dashboard.. GOOGLE!
